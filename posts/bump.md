In the fast-paced world of mobile technology, few applications have captured the imagination and attention of users like [Bump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3rG2OfgdCE).

Founded in 2008 by David Lieb, Andy Huibers, and Jake Mintz, Bump Technologies introduced a revolutionary iOS and Android app that allowed smartphone users to seamlessly transfer contact information, photos, and files between devices by simply physically bumping them together.

The genesis of Bump stemmed from a personal pain point David Lieb experienced during his MBA. Struggling to exchange contact information with classmates, [Lieb](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidlieb/) recognised the potential for a solution in the nascent smartphone market, particularly with the iPhone. Inspired by the success of a classmate's app and armed with a background in engineering (Electrical Engineering Undergrad and a Master's degree in Machine Learning), Lieb embarked on a journey to develop a novel solution to the problem.

What set Bump apart was its innovative use of accelerometers, GPS, and wifi technology to facilitate seamless device-to-device communication. By using these technologies, Bump created a simple and intuitive user experience that resonated with users and quickly gained popularity.

The act of physically bumping phones together became iconic.

Bump's go-to-market strategy was characterised by a combination of organic growth and strategic partnerships. Leveraging the growing popularity of the iPhone and the burgeoning app store ecosystem, Bump capitalised on media interest and user enthusiasm to drive adoption. Additionally, the company's participation in initiatives such as Apple’s  ["there's an app for that"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U8mlfweVXc) campaign – after being broadcast as the [billionth app](https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2009/04/24Apples-Revolutionary-App-Store-Downloads-Top-One-Billion-in-Just-Nine-Months/#:~:text=The%20one%20billionth%20app%2C%20Bump%20created%20by,Connor%20Mulcahey%2C%20age%2013%2C%20of%20Weston%2C%20CT.) store download – helped to further elevate its profile and increase downloads.

Additionally, the company's pivot towards peer-to-peer photo-sharing with the launch of [Flock](https://vimeo.com/46398388) failed to replicate the same level of success. Even with the large number of downloads, very few people used the app regularly. Even the power users only used it occasionally. One main reason for the lack of active users is that even if images were exchanged, smartphones had limited storage, and people were reluctant to back things up, as this could only be done by connecting phones to computers, which added friction.

In terms of intellectual property, Bump Technologies held several patents related to inter-device communication and bumping technology, providing a foundation for its innovative solutions. However, despite these advancements, the company ultimately struggled to maintain its competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.

The lack of active users also made it difficult to find a convincing monetisation model (ads, subscriptions, etc), highlighting the difficulty of maintaining relevance in a rapidly evolving industry.

Recognising the need for strategic partnerships and resources to support continued growth, Bump Technologies decided to [sell to Google](https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/16/bump-mobile-contact-sharing-app-acquired-by-google-will-stay-alive-for-now/) in 2013. Not only did the Bump and Google have product and culture fit, but the acquisition also provided Bump with access to Google's vast resources and expertise, ultimately paving the way for the development of Google Photos.
